#### Potential topic related LST in Siberian
1. I would like to discuss  LULC by using methods such as pcc, transformation matrix in Siberian, summarize NDVI according to year, season, and short-term (using STLs or greenbrown), and evaluate their impact on LST (here are discussions include, correlation analysis, Lag effect on LST,  statistics of LST over different land use over time, etc.)

2.  I hope to use neural networks to estimate a nonlinear relationship between LULC, NDVI, DEM (or other independent indicators) and LST. I may decompose NDVI into inter-annual trend, annual anomalies, seasonal trends, and anomalies for feature engineering inputs. Further,MLs like multilayer perceptrons could be used to predict LULC. Future NDVI could be modelling based on trend decomposition. Finally we could predict LST based on previous work. One of the challenging is determination of uncertainty

#### Potential topic related soil mapping
1. I hope to obtain Vis-NIR, HSI based on aerial vehicle or mobile, then USE machine learning to map soil properties (moisture, organic matter, etc.)
2. Further, based on there are some global public datasets. I think we could reduce labor cost and significantly improve the accuracy of the results at the same time by using transfer model. 
3. Another potential topic is I d like to use an end-to-end method, or map soil based on classification in advance, and then use change detection technology to explore soil changes in space and time. (For this part, I need to learn more about soil, but I am familiar with change detection technology and classification)

#### Topic related Vegetation Dynamic and anomaly
1. I hope to predict vegetation trends and uncertainties combining multivariate temporal and spatial information and seasonal/age changes using deep learning and time series.(eg: ConvLSTM, dropout for uncertainty, time series decomposition)
2. I hope to quantify the class and range of space-time anomalies(eg: fire), and combine these two topics together.

(If all topic are not of your interest, please talk to me. Your opinion is important)
